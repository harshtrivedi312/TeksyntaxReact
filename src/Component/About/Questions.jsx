              The choice is yours! Teksyntax offers both remote and in-person

              you opt for a remote course, you&apos;ll experience a learning

              if you enjoy learning alongside your peers and can conveniently
              attend classes on campus, our in-person courses provide the added
              advantage of utilizing our beautiful classrooms and workspaces.

              best format that aligns with your personal circumstances and
