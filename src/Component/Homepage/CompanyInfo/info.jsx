          A significant problem in tech education is that most bootcamps require
          students to have a significant background in coding just to join a
          program. However, at our organization, we not only address this issue
          but also go above and beyond. We understand the importance of
          practical experience and securing job placements for our students.
          With over 10 years of instruction, a global alumni network of 13,000+
          individuals, and extensive research into Learning Science, the labor
          force, and pedagogy, we have meticulously crafted a curriculum that
          not only builds a solid foundation but also prepares students for
          real-world challenges.

          What sets us apart is our unwavering commitment to our students&apos;
          long-term success. We provide lifetime support through our dedicated
          Career Services team, ensuring that students have access to resources
          and guidance even after completing the program. Our comprehensive
          placements service helps connect students with relevant job
          opportunities, leveraging our extensive network and industry
          partnerships.

          By prioritizing both education and career advancement, we strive to
          empower our students with the skills, knowledge, and support needed to
          thrive in the tech industry.
